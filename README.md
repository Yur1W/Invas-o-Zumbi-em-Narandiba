## Overview
This project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of my partner and me in building a complete 2D game in Unity. It is a practical exam for the Programação de Jogos (JD0008) course and it`s used for assessing our understanding and application of the concepts studied in class, such as physics, C# scripting, scene composition. Following the official document “Invasão Zumbi em Narandiba”, this project represents an important milestone in a game developer’s toolkit.

## What is the Exam about?
The exam consists of creating a simple 2D game in Unity based on the concept “Invasão Zumbi em Narandiba”, using the assets provided by the professor. The focus is on: 

### Programming of game elements (70%):

- Applying 2D physics (Rigidbody2D, Colliders, triggers, etc.).

- Creating C# scripts for movement (player, camera, enemies) and the main game loop.

- Using materials, prefabs and particle systems to structure and polish the game.

### Visual presentation (10%):

- Organizing and positioning the assets in the scene to build a clear, readable environment.

### Game design (20%):

- Defining the gameplay (controls, feedback, difficulty).

- Implementing the proposed narrative with the main character Sargento Nascimento, an ex-military expert in urban operations who fights with an axe.

- Creating the game mechanics: victory/defeat conditions, score, timer and progression, including a stronger “super” form after defeating a certain number of zombies.

## Game Scene Script
The world didn’t end all at once. It was gradual — silently, like a fever that begins with a single shiver. The cities fell before they even realized what they were facing. Civilization went dark amid sirens, screams, and screens that broadcast chaos until the very last second. Now, the streets are empty. What was once life has become ruin. Buildings coated in dust, cars stopped in the middle of avenues, half-open doors that whisper memories of what once was. The wind drags papers, lost voices, echoes of a past no one can reach anymore.

The living have become rare. Some hide, others fight to survive… and there are those who no longer remember why they still fight. Hunger, fear, and loneliness eat away faster than any wound. With each passing day, there is less hope — and more monsters, inside and outside of people. But even among the ashes, there are still those who believe. Those who refuse to accept the end. Because as long as there is someone breathing, walking, scanning the horizon in search of another survivor… the story isn’t over yet.

They declare that Narandiba will be the first step toward the world’s destruction.
